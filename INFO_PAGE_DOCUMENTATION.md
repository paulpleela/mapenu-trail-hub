### 1. **Platform Overview**
- Explains MAPENU's primary purpose: Rolling Hills Detection
- Highlights key features:
  - Rolling Hills Detection algorithm (60% frequency + 40% amplitude)
  - Comprehensive terrain analysis
  - Elevation profiles and difficulty scoring

### 2. **Data Collection Methods**

#### Method 1: GPX Files (Recommended) 📍
**What it is:** GPS Exchange Format - Standard for recording trail coordinates

**Recommended Apps:**
- **GPS Tracks** (iOS) - Accurate GPS tracking with offline maps

**Best Practices Included:**
- ✓ Enable high-accuracy GPS mode
- ✓ Record at 1-5 second intervals
- ✓ Keep phone accessible
- ✓ Ensure sufficient battery
- ✓ Start/stop recording properly

#### Method 2: LiDAR Files (.las format) 📦
**What it is:** Light Detection and Ranging - Creates 3D point clouds using laser scanning

**Recommended Apps:**
- **dot3D** - Professional-grade scanning
- **Polycam** - Easy-to-use 3D scanner
- **Scaniverse** - Free LiDAR scanning

**Requirements:**
- iPhone 12 Pro or later / iPad Pro (2020+)
- Export in .las or .laz format
- Good lighting conditions
- Slow, steady movement
- Overlap scan areas

#### Method 3: QSpatial Open Data (Queensland) 🗺️
**What it is:** Free high-resolution (1-meter) LiDAR elevation data from Queensland Government

**How to Access:**
1. Visit QSpatial Portal
2. Search for "LiDAR" or "Digital Elevation Model"
3. Select region of interest
4. Download GeoTIFF (.tif) or LAS files
5. Upload to MAPENU

**Note:** Currently used for Brisbane region 3D terrain visualizations

### 3. **What MAPENU Analyzes**

#### Visual 1: 2D Elevation Profile Chart 📊
Shows:
- Elevation changes over distance
- Gradient/slope percentages
- Cumulative elevation gain/loss
- Visual identification of climbs and descents

#### Visual 2: 3D Terrain Visualization 🏔️
Shows:
- Interactive 3D terrain surface
- Trail path overlaid on real elevation
- Surrounding topography
- Rotatable and zoomable view

#### Metric 1: Rolling Hills Index (0-1) 📈
Measures:
- Trail "bumpiness" or undulation
- Frequency: # of hills per km (60% weight)
- Amplitude: Average hill size (40% weight)
- Threshold: Elevation changes >1 meter

**Example Display:**
```
Example: 0.65 → MODERATE ROLLING
[Progress bar showing 65%]
```

#### Metric 2: Difficulty Score & Time ⏱️
Calculates:
- Distance factor (30%)
- Elevation gain factor (40%)
- Rolling hills factor (30%)
- Time via Naismith's Rule
- Classification: Easy/Moderate/Hard/Extreme

**Example:**
- Difficulty Score: 6.5/10
- Estimated Time: 3.2 hours
