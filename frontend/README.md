# MAPENU Frontend

A modern React-based web application for trail analysis, visualization, and sharing.

## Features

- **GPX & LiDAR Uploads**: Upload trail data from GPX files, LiDAR scans, or use MAPENU's built-in GPX Tracker. The upload modal supports multiple formats and guides users through the process.
- **Interactive Map Interface**: The Dashboard displays an interactive map with selectable trails, start/end markers, and overlays for elevation and terrain. Users can refresh data, filter trails, and view real-time updates.
- **Trail Metrics & Insights**: For each trail, view detailed statistics including elevation gain/loss, total distance, rolling hills count, technical rating, and difficulty score. Metrics are visualized with charts and summary cards.
- **Elevation Profile & Slope Analysis**: The ElevationChart component shows the trail’s elevation profile, slope variation (highlighted in yellow), and key stats like elevation range and slope extremes.
- **High-Resolution Terrain Data**: Explore official QSpatial DEM and user-supplied LiDAR visualizations in 3D using Three.js. The TrailVisualization component renders interactive terrain models and point clouds.
- **Trail Recommendations**: The app suggests similar trails based on your activity and preferences, helping users discover new routes.
- **User Guide & Analytics**: The InfoPage provides comprehensive help, best practices, and explanations of all metrics and scales. The Analytics page summarizes network-wide statistics, difficulty distributions, and trail comparisons.
- **Built-in GPX Tracker**: A dedicated page for recording and exporting GPX tracks directly from the platform, streamlining field data collection.

## Tech Stack

- **React** (with Vite for fast development and hot reload)
- **Tailwind CSS** (for modern, responsive UI)
- **Node.js** (for development tooling)
- **Three.js** (for 3D terrain and LiDAR visualization)
- **Fetch API** (for backend communication)
