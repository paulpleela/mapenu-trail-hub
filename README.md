# MAPENU 🗺️

A modern, innovative platform for trail analysis, visualization, and certification. MAPENU combines geospatial data science, interactive web technologies, and advanced terrain analytics to support athletes, certifiers, and organizers in understanding trail complexity and rolling hill patterns.

---

## Overview

MAPENU enables users to upload, analyze, and visualize trail elevation data from GPX, LiDAR, and DTM sources. The system detects and classifies rolling hills, validates results on real-world trails, and presents intuitive visual outputs for decision-making and certification.

## Key Features

- **Rolling Hill Detection & Classification**: Identifies human-scale undulations in trail elevation data, supporting difficulty ratings and certification.
- **Real Trail Validation**: Tested on actual trail segments (e.g., Mt Coot-tha) with field measurements and expert feedback.
- **Reproducible Terrain Analysis**: Consistent outputs across different trails and datasets, supporting scalable assessment.
- **Intuitive Visualizations**: Interactive maps, elevation charts, and summary metrics for stakeholders.
- **Secure & Ethical Data Handling**: User privacy and data security are prioritized throughout the platform.
